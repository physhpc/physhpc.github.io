# Call for papers

Research in natural sciences like physics and chemistry is increasingly moving towards massive use of high-performance computing systems to numerically solve problems for which no analytical solutions are known. We are currently at an unprecedented favorable juncture in Europe due to the investments made through the Horizon Europe Programme, which has invested substantial resources in constructing high-performance computing infrastructure to achieve Exa-scale capabilities. In this scenario, it is crucial to design codes to exploit the overall set of available resources optimally, permitting them to scale to wider and finer domains in both space and time, thus enabling more insightful applications to natural sciences. Scientific codes sometimes suffer from the lack of state-of-the-art solutions proposed by computer science, like optimized data structures reducing memory space footprint, fast stencil algorithms, and conflict-free write procedures specifically developed for many-core accelerators like GPUs or load-balancing routines for both when and how to load balance for high-performance computing clusters. Nevertheless, such codes often embed original algorithmic solutions and data structures that could inspire the development of new algorithms and tools or improve existing ones in computer science. The encounter between natural science and computer science could represent an enriching opportunity for all disciplines involved. Aiming to feed this collaboration, the workshop is intended to be an interdisciplinary forum for comparison and discussion between natural science and computer science to establish a synergy between these disciplines and favour the advancement of knowledge in each of them. Authors are encouraged to submit original, unpublished research or critical reviews on algorithms, models and tools for parallel computing applied to scientific problems with emphasis on original solutions and open issues.


## Important dates

* Submission deadline: May 6th, 2024 (AOE)
* Acceptance Notification: June 17th, 2024 (AOE)
* Revisions of accepted papers due: July 1st, 2024 (AOE)

## Submissions
Authors need to submit their work through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=europar24-ws-phd-poster-whpc). Submissions must be in [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions can be in the form of full papers (10-12 pages), short papers (5-9 pages), abstracts (up to 4 pages), or posters. 

## Reviews 
Each contribution will undergo a blind review process by three reviewers belonging to the program committee. 
All submitted manuscripts will be checked for originality by [iThenticate](https://www.ithenticate.com/) (papers that show an insufficient originality might be rejected without a review). Reviews will be double-blind, and papers get assessed for quality, relevance, and presentation of contributions.
For each accepted contribution, at least one author must register and present their work to the workshop.

## Proceedings
Accepted full papers will appear in a special volume of the Euro-Par 2024 LNCS proceedings.
