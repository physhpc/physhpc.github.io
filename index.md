## Scope

PHYSHPC is an interdisciplinary workshop hosted by **[Euro-Par 2024](https://2024.euro-par.org/)**, the prime European conference covering all aspects of parallel and distributed processing. The workshop aims to create a meeting point between the communities of physicists (and, in general, of researchers from the natural sciences) and computer scientists who deal with computational problems and high-performance computing. Such a meeting is a stimulating opportunity for both communities to advance disciplinary knowledge thanks to sharing experiences, needs and original solutions. New scientific collaborations and opportunities for international research projects may be started.

## Topics
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Emerging and high-performance computing in complex systems modelling and simulation using FDM, PIC, Cellular Automata and other methods
* High-performance technologies, such as MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and Sycl, for scientific applications
* Hardware approaches (e.g., FPGAs, Neuromorphic computing) of high-performance computing in modeling and simulation
* Optimization algorithms related to parallel simulation of scientific applications, such as synchronization, load balancing, coarse grain optimization
* Performance models and their integration into the design of efficient parallel algorithms for heterogeneous platforms
* High-performance software libraries for scientific applications (Blas, ScaLAPACK, MAGMA, Plasma, GROMACS, Quantum Espresso, Yambo)
* Simulation of quantum systems in HPC and quantum computing, quantum reservoir computing
* Many-body systems
* High-performance simulation of fluids and plasma
* Computational chemistry and quantum chemistry
