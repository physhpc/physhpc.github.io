#    Joel Falcou is an associate professor at the University of Paris-Sud and
#    researcher at the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Numerical Sciences (LISN)
#    in Orsay, France. He serves as a scientific and training advisor for CODE
#    RECKONS. His research focuses on the design of Embedded Domain Specific
#    Languages for parallel computing on various architectures and developing a
#    formal framework meta-programming analysis.
#
#    As he needs something to pad his academic paper up to at least eight pages,
#    he usually plays around with various application fields like real-time image
#    processing on embedded architectures or HPC on multi-core clusters. He is
#    the co-host of the [*C++FRUG Meetup*](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/User-Group-Cpp-Francophone/),
#    president of the C++FRUG Association and co-organizes the [*CPPP Conference*](https://cppp.fr/).
#title: Tools of the Trade Embracing Our Inner Craftsman
#abstract: >
#  Designing software tools and libraries represents a critical yet often
#  overlooked aspect in the field of software engineering. Many prioritize rapid
#  algorithm or application development, overlooking the productivity gains from
#  thoughtful tools and library design. This presentation will argue for a more
#  balanced approach, emphasizing the craftsmanship involved in creating robust,
#  effective software tools. By focusing on the development of specialized,
#  domain-specific tools and libraries, developers can achieve higher
#  productivity and software quality. The talk will cover best practices, case
#  studies, and methodologies for tool and library design, aiming to inspire
#  attendees to embrace their inner craftsman in software development.
