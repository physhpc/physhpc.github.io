  bio: >
    Joel Falcou is an associate professor at the University of Paris-Sud and
    researcher at the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Numerical Sciences (LISN)
    in Orsay, France. He serves as a scientific and training advisor for CODE
    RECKONS. His research focuses on the design of Embedded Domain Specific
    Languages for parallel computing on various architectures and developing a
    formal framework meta-programming analysis.

    As he needs something to pad his academic paper up to at least eight pages,
    he usually plays around with various application fields like real-time image
    processing on embedded architectures or HPC on multi-core clusters. He is
    the co-host of the [*C++FRUG Meetup*](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/User-Group-Cpp-Francophone/),
    president of the C++FRUG Association and co-organizes the [*CPPP Conference*](https://cppp.fr/).
title: Tools of the Trade Embracing Our Inner Craftsman
abstract: >
  Designing software tools and libraries represents a critical yet often
  overlooked aspect in the field of software engineering. Many prioritize rapid
  algorithm or application development, overlooking the productivity gains from
  thoughtful tools and library design. This presentation will argue for a more
  balanced approach, emphasizing the craftsmanship involved in creating robust,
  effective software tools. By focusing on the development of specialized,
  domain-specific tools and libraries, developers can achieve higher
  productivity and software quality. The talk will cover best practices, case
  studies, and methodologies for tool and library design, aiming to inspire
  attendees to embrace their inner craftsman in software development.
