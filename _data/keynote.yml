        Fabio Bacchini is Assistant Professor at the Centre for mathematical Plasma Astrophysics of KU Leuven (Belgium) since 2022. He obtained his PhD from KU Leuven in December 2018 with a thesis on Newtonian and relativistic particle methods for plasma simulations. Before the beginning of his tenure-track, he spent 3 years as a postdoc in Germany, Belgium, and the United States. His work has primarily focused on solar and high-energy astroplasma simulations, with an emphasis on the development and application of novel numerical methods for massively parallel computer codes.

        Massively parallel computer codes are the paramount standard for simulations of astrophysical plasmas in modern scientific research. From the solar environment to the surroundings of supermassive black holes, simulations have helped shed light on many previously unknown processes concerning plasmas in the Universe. Given the very limited space offered by analytic calculations, continuing efforts devoted to the development of modern, reliable simulations tools are imperative. In this talk, I will review the main computing approaches employed in modern astroplasma research, and focus on the challenges and opportunities offered by the newest computing technologies on the market.

His current research interests include Parallel Computing, High-Performance Computing, Quantum Computing, Swarm Intelligence and Distributed Simulation.
      title: A Survey on Cellular Automata Parallel Execution Techniques
      abstract: >
        Cellular Automata (CA) is a widely adopted paradigm for various physical systems, encompassing fluid dynamics, plasmas, spin systems, statistical mechanics, and natural phenomena such as lava flow, landslide, and prey-predator models. In each of these domains, CA modelling is able to capture the complexity of these systems by defining the interaction of their elementary units via relatively simple local rules. Due to an inherently parallel structure, CA executions can gain significant performance enhancements through parallel computing. In this talk, I will delve into the basic techniques for the parallel execution of CA on shared and distributed memory systems, as well as GPU architectures Moreover, I will explore optimization strategies, such as load balancing techniques, aimed at further amplifying the efficiency of parallel executions. In addition, I will introduce engineering practices geared towards facilitating transparent code execution. These practices aim to shield modellers from intricate computer science issues associated with execution contexts and optimization strategies, enabling them to focus solely on the modelling aspects of their work.
